# AI Learning & Projects Repository

This repository contains my personal learning materials, experiments, and projects while transitioning from iOS/Flutter development to AI/ML engineering.  
It is structured to keep both academic learning outputs and practical projects organized.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **01_Foundation_Python/**  
  Basic Python programming, data structures, and algorithms.

- **02_Data_Handling/**  
  Data cleaning, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, and other preprocessing techniques.

- **03_ML_Classic/**  
  Classical Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, regression, classification, clustering).

- **04_Deep_Learning/**  
  Deep learning experiments using PyTorch / TensorFlow (CV, NLP, etc.).

- **05_Projects/**  
  End-to-end mini projects. Each project has its own folder with `README.md` for setup and explanation.  
  Examples: Titanic EDA, churn prediction, healthcare-related projects.

- **06_Frontend/**  
  React, Vue, and other frontend demos for data visualization or AI-related UIs.

- **07_iOS/**  
  Legacy iOS projects (Objective-C, Swift, SwiftUI).

- **08_Flutter/**  
  Flutter projects and experiments (cross-platform mobile development).

- **09_Utils/**  
  Utility scripts, helper functions, reusable code snippets.

- **Assets/**  
  Images, diagrams, and other non-code resources.

- **docs/** (optional)  
  Notes, reports, or documentation related to AI coursework.
